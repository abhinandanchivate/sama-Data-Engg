| **1**     | Create Ubuntu/Debian VM                 | Launch a VM using `gcloud compute instances create`, enable HTTP/HTTPS, and SSH into it |
| **2**     | Configure Preemptible VM                | Create a cost-efficient preemptible VM and verify its limited lifetime                  |
| **3**     | Custom VM Image Creation                | Install software on VM, snapshot disk, and create a reusable image                      |
| **4**     | Instance Template + MIG                 | Use instance templates to deploy Managed Instance Groups (MIGs) with health checks      |
| **5**     | App Deployment on App Engine (Standard) | Deploy Python/Node app with `app.yaml`, test, and redeploy                              |
| **6**     | App Engine (Flexible) with Docker       | Use Dockerfile and `app.yaml` to deploy on flexible environment                         |
| **7**     | Cloud Build CI/CD Pipeline              | Create `cloudbuild.yaml` to auto-deploy app on every code push                          |
| **8**     | VPC and Subnet Setup                    | Create a custom VPC, regional subnet, and associate with VM                             |
| **9**     | Define Firewall Rules                   | Configure rules to allow/deny traffic (e.g., allow HTTP on port 80)                     |
| **10**    | Private Google Access                   | Enable Private Google Access for internal resources to access GCP APIs                  |
| **11**    | Shared VPC Configuration                | Setup Shared VPC between host and service project to centralize networking              |
