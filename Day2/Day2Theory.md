#  GCP Storage Services – Quick Conceptual Deep Dive



---

## 1️⃣ **Cloud Storage (Object Storage)**

### 🔹 What:

* **Object storage** for blobs (media, backups, data lakes).
* Fully managed, scalable, durable.
* Organized via **buckets**.

### 🔹 Why Use:

* For **unstructured** data.
* Fast setup, secure, integrates with all GCP services.

### 🔹 When to Use:

* Storing **images, videos, backups, ML models, logs**, static websites.
* When you need **high availability**, global access, or **signed URLs**.

### 🔹 Real-time Usage:

* ML training data storage
* Web app serving via Cloud CDN + Cloud Storage
* Backup & Disaster Recovery
* IoT data dumps

### 🔹 Cost Optimization:

| Storage Class | Use Case            | Cost                         |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Standard**  | Active use          | High                         |
| **Nearline**  | Access once/month   | Low                          |
| **Coldline**  | Access once/quarter | Lower                        |
| **Archive**   | Rare access         | Lowest (high retrieval cost) |

### 🔹 Advanced Points:

* Lifecycle rules for automatic archival/deletion
* IAM vs ACL for security
* Signed URLs for external access

## 2️⃣ **Cloud SQL (Relational Database)**

### 🔹 What:

* Managed **relational database** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
* Auto-patching, replication, backup.

### 🔹 Why Use:

* For transactional workloads that require **ACID compliance**, **SQL joins**, relational integrity.

### 🔹 When to Use:

* Core business apps, eCommerce, CMS, ERP, legacy migrations
* RESTful APIs requiring relational data

### 🔹 Real-time Usage:

* Customer management systems
* Product catalog management
* Financial records
* Legacy Oracle migrations

### 🔹 Cost Optimization:

* Use **db-f1-micro** for dev/test (Free tier eligible)
* Choose **read replicas** instead of scaling up vertically
* Schedule **auto-start/stop** for non-prod instances

                         ┌────────────┐
                       │  App Tier  │
                       └────┬───────┘
                            │
                 ┌──────────▼──────────┐
                 │ Primary (Read/Write)│
                 │  Cloud SQL Instance │
                 └──────────┬──────────┘
                            │
         ┌──────────────────┼──────────────────┐
         ▼                  ▼                  ▼
  Read Replica 1     Read Replica 2      Read Replica 3
 (Read-Only SQL)    (Regional Replica)   (Analytics Use)


### 🔹 Advanced Points:

* Supports **private IP**, VPC peering
* Use with **Cloud Functions**, **App Engine**, **Dataflow**
* **Backups + PITR** (Point-in-Time Recovery)

---

## 3️⃣ **Cloud Firestore (NoSQL Document DB)**

### 🔹 What:

* Serverless, **document-based NoSQL** DB.
* JSON-like nested structure.
* Supports real-time syncing.

### 🔹 Why Use:

* Ideal for **hierarchical, nested, user-specific** data.
* Real-time syncing with mobile/web apps.

### 🔹 When to Use:

* **Real-time apps** (chats, dashboards)
* Web/mobile apps with Firebase
* CRUD + offline support
* Role-based hierarchical documents

### 🔹 Real-time Usage:

* Real-time chat or collaboration tools
* IoT dashboards
* Multi-tenant CRUD SaaS apps

### 🔹 Cost Optimization:

* **Free quota** under Firebase Spark
* Avoid deep sub-collections (count as separate reads)
* Use **composite indexes** wisely (paid)

### 🔹 Advanced Points:

* Multi-region availability (e.g., `nam5`)
* Firestore security rules for row-level access
* Query limitations: No joins, need denormalization

---

## 4️⃣ **Cloud Bigtable (Wide-Column NoSQL DB)**

### 🔹 What:

* Low-latency, **high-throughput NoSQL** DB for time series, analytics, IoT.
* Horizontally scalable to **petabytes**

### 🔹 Why Use:

* Massive read/write scalability.
* Strong consistency with low latency.

### 🔹 When to Use:

* **Time-series**, **IoT sensor**, **clickstream**, or **log analytics**
* High ingestion + real-time analytics

### 🔹 Real-time Usage:

* IoT telemetry (e.g., smart grids)
* Fraud detection analytics
* User behavior tracking (clicks/logs)

### 🔹 Cost Optimization:

* Minimum cost: **1 node per cluster (\~\$0.65/hr)**
* Ideal when row-key design is efficient
* Can autoscale, but requires **careful schema design**

### 🔹 Advanced Points:

* No SQL; use **cbt** or client SDKs
* Design **row key** wisely to prevent hotspots
* Integrates with **BigQuery, Dataflow, Pub/Sub**
